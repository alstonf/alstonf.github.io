Good morning respected teacher and friend's my dear

Today I will talk about the huge significance of cant even every small thing in the world nature. Mature is an Insepevable part of our life without which we imagine imagine our life. it not provides us with vesources for our survival but also makes our enviroment healthy and beautiful for instance a flower is tiny but sufficient to bring a smile on your face, the micro-organism's might not be seen through naked eyes but they play a key role in ensuring the continuous flow of the ecosystem, a tiny seed may seem to useless but they play a significant role in preventing seil evasion and flood's one day it becomes the source of your survival, the bushes often look of no use but they play a significant role in preventing Soil erosion and flood's, Just as a sight of nature gives your entive mind and body a soothing feeling and vejuvenates you. Every component of nature has it's own significance. Thus, everything in nature has a vole to play and make out life better, easier and happy.

Therefore, it becomes your duty our duty to take care of such divine and giving nature it's due respect and cove in retorn

So. don't dencture the nature; it is a gift from god to us. Don't disturb the natural cycle, let them run as usual. Save the nature as we have no another place to live.

Thank you !
